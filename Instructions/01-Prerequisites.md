# Prerequisites

Welcome! This is the starting point for the step-by-step instructions of this workshop. Throughout the next twelve tasks, you will train an AI model for airport security and make it available to the users as a web app. You will be using Azure Cognitive Services Custom Vision and Azure Web Apps to achieve this. Along the way, you will learn (or practice) a lot of useful skills for working with Azure, such as resource provisioning, app configuration, and Cloud Shell CLI.

This workshop aims to be an introduction to Azure and does not require any previous knowledge of the platform (or any other IT skills).

Since all tasks can be achieved through the browser, no additional software needs to be installed.

The sole requirement for participation in this workshop is that you have access to an Azure account. If you do not have an Azure account, you can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

Once you have an Azure account, you can begin the workshop with [provisioning your first Azure resources](02-Provision%20a%20Cognitive%20Services%20resource.md).
