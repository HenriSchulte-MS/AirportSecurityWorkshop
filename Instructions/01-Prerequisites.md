# Prerequisites

Welcome! This workshop aims to be an introduction to Azure and does not require any previous knowledge of the platform (or any other IT skills).

Since all tasks can be achieved through the browser, no additional software needs to be installed.

The sole requirement for participation in this workshop is that you have access to an Azure account. If you do not have an Azure account, you can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

Once you have an Azure account, you can begin the workshop with [provisioning your first Azure resources](Instructions/02-Provision%20a%20Cognitive%20Services%20resource.md).
